# Geoffrey Gordon Ashbrook

I am a data scientist, fiddle player, and flute maker from Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. My passion for interdisciplinary and practical studies has lead me from [Artificial Intelligence research](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/646145.678706) in 2002 at CU Boulder, to biology, to K-12 science and language teaching, and back to AI Data Science. I completed the Data Science program at [The Bloom Institute of Technology](https://www.bloomtech.com/) in 2020. 

I am interested in interdisciplinary projects that span best practice and organizational management, education and human development, economics and finance, health and healthcare, consciousness, law, visual arts, poetry, botany, economic-botany, linguistics, statistics, language comprehension, writing systems, international studies, mythology, history, traditional music, astronomy, cooking, baking, pickling, woodworking, mindfulness, Shakespeare, Lean Six Sigma, Philosophy of Science, literature, digital security, poetry, agile & scrum project management, asteroid mining, quantum information theory, folk dancing, astrobiology, etc. Practical applications of data abound.
